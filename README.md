# Todo Web Application

This is a simple todo web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with local storage functionality.

## Features

- **Adding Todo Entries**: Users can add todo entries with priorities (low, medium, high). The color of the todo entry will be determined by its priority level.
- **Validation**: Users will receive an alert message if they try to add a todo without entering any text.
- **Displaying Todo Entries**: After adding a todo entry, a table row will be created displaying the title of the todo, its priority, status (defaulted to pending), and an archive button.
- **Toggle Status**: Users can toggle the status of a todo entry from pending to completed. Completed entries can then be moved to the archive.
- **Archive Page**: Archived todo entries are moved to a separate archive page. Users can view, restore, or delete entries from the archive.
- **Filters**: Two filters are available:
  - Priority Filter: Users can filter todo entries by priority (low, medium, high).
  - Status Filter: Users can filter todo entries by status (completed or pending).
